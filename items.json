    "desc": "<p>When we first arrived on Earth’s Ebela Island, I was struck by how different everything felt. The place was mysterious and magical, with its deep forests and ancient ruins, but it was also a world away from where I grew up. My father, Syl, and I moved here to start over, hoping that a fresh beginning would help us all forget the pain of the past. But no matter how hard we tried, the absence of my mother still hung over us like a shadow. She vanished years ago, leaving behind questions that would never be answered, and even though we didn’t talk about it much, we all felt the void she left behind.</p><p>Growing up wasn’t easy for me. My blue skin and... well, let’s just say my “unique” appearance made me a target for bullies. Kids can be cruel, and I learned that the hard way. They teased me relentlessly, and it hurt more than I ever let on. But I’m not one to dwell on the bad stuff. I’ve always tried to keep a cheery attitude, even when things were tough. My dad says it’s one of my best qualities, finding the bright side, no matter what.</p><p>When we moved to Rosestone, I didn’t know what to expect. It’s a small suburban town, but there was something comforting about its ordinary charm. The Ruians here were different, too. They were kind, welcoming even. It was like they didn’t see me as some strange alien girl; they just saw me as Zet, another neighbor in their little community. That warmth helped heal a lot of the scars I carried from my childhood.</p><p>The best thing that happened in Rosestone, though, was meeting Auray Asq'aro. She’s a genius, seriously! And the best friend I could ever ask for. She understood me in a way that no one else did. Seeing how much I needed companionship, she created Shine Retrac, an artificial Ruian boy who’s now like a little brother to me. Shine is so full of life and energy; he practically radiates happiness. Together, we explore Rosestone, finding adventure in the most ordinary places.</p><p>Living here has taught me so much about accepting myself. The kindness I’ve found, the friends I’ve made, and the bond I share with my family have turned Rosestone into more than just a new home. It’s a place where I’ve finally found peace with who I am. And that’s something I never thought I’d have.</p>"
