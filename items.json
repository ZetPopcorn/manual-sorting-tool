The place was mysterious and magical, with its deep forests and ancient ruins, but it was also a world away from where I grew up. My father, Syl, and I moved here to start over, hoping that a fresh beginning would help us all forget the pain of the past. But no matter how hard we tried, the absence of my mother still hung over us like a shadow. She vanished years ago, leaving behind questions that would never be answered, and even though we didn’t talk about it much, we all felt the void she left behind.</p><p>Growing up wasn’t easy for me. My blue skin and... well, let’s just say my “unique” appearance made me a target for bullies. Kids can be cruel, and I learned that the hard way. They teased me relentlessly, and it hurt more than I ever let on. But I’m not one to dwell on the bad stuff. I’ve always tried to keep a cheery attitude, even when things were tough. My dad says it’s one of my best qualities, finding the bright side, no matter what.</p><p>When we moved to Rosestone, I didn’t know what to expect. It’s a small suburban town, but there was something comforting about its ordinary charm. The Ruians here were different, too. They were kind, welcoming even. It was like they didn’t see me as some strange alien girl; they just saw me as Zet, another neighbor in their little community. That warmth helped heal a lot of the scars I carried from my childhood.</p><p>The best thing that happened in Rosestone, though, was meeting Auray Asq'aro. She’s a genius, seriously! And the best friend I could ever ask for. She understood me in a way that no one else did. Seeing how much I needed companionship, she created Shine Retrac, an artificial Ruian boy who’s now like a little brother to me. Shine is so full of life and energy; he practically radiates happiness. Together, we explore Rosestone, finding adventure in the most ordinary places.</p><p>Living here has taught me so much about accepting myself. The kindness I’ve found, the friends I’ve made, and the bond I share with my family have turned Rosestone into more than just a new home. It’s a place where I’ve finally found peace with who I am. And that’s something I never thought I’d have.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>" },

Born not of nature but of invention, Shine was meticulously engineered in the depths of Auray’s laboratory to be a companion for Zet Arder. While his grey, rubbery skin is a subtle departure from the vibrant hues of most Ruians, his unassuming appearance was intentional—a balance between familiarity and function, ensuring his acceptance while hinting at his unique origins.</p><p>Shine’s personality reflects his purpose. He is gracious and kind, a calming presence in Zet’s life. Their bond is not one of creator and construct but of equals, with Shine serving as Zet’s loyal companion and, over time, her partner. Though they call each other boyfriend and girlfriend, Shine remains dedicated to his role as a supportive figure. He tends to Zet’s home in Rosestone with quiet diligence, managing chores and ensuring her life runs smoothly. For all his otherworldly abilities, his focus remains grounded in simplicity and devotion.</p><p>Yet Shine’s body holds remarkable secrets, a marvel of Auray’s ingenuity. His rubbery form can stretch without limit, an ability that grants him both versatility and resilience. Invincible to physical harm, Shine can survive circumstances that would destroy most beings, though he experiences pain like any other. This paradox makes him both fearless and deeply empathetic. His invulnerability is not a shield from suffering but a reminder of the sacrifices inherent in his design. When exploring Ebela Island, he approaches its wonders and dangers with cautious curiosity, meeting its diverse inhabitants with warmth and openness. Despite his travels and the fascinating figures he encounters, Shine’s loyalty to Zet is unwavering, his heart firmly tethered to the girl who gave him a purpose beyond his origins.</p><p>Though created to serve, Shine has developed a quiet independence. He reflects often on his identity—part invention, part individual—and the ethical intricacies of his existence. These musings are private, shared only in fleeting moments with Zet or Auray. He embraces his life with gratitude, finding meaning in his relationships and the experiences he gathers on his journeys. Shine is, in many ways, a mirror for those he meets: unassuming yet extraordinary, humble yet unbreakable, a being who embodies the complexity of creation and the simplicity of kindness.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>" },

Yeah, she’s pretty hard to miss. If you ever see a tall Ruian girl with purple skin, rocking black chokers, fishnets, and all those edgy clothes, that’s her. She’s got this whole “hardcore” thing going on, totally opposite of me. I’m all smiles and sunshine, but Syl? She’s more... intense. Always has been. She’s a bit taller than me, too—7'2, not that she ever lets me forget it. But trust me, she’s not just all attitude and style. Syl’s got this strong sense of nobility to her. You know, that kind of high moral compass that just demands respect.</p><p>When we were little, Syl was like my personal bodyguard. Seriously, whenever kids would mess with me for being, well, me, she was there—strong, smart, and unshakable. I’ll never forget how she stood up for me. It wasn’t just about beating up bullies (although, yeah, she could totally take them). She was always the one who saw things clearly, who knew what was right and wouldn’t let anyone push us around. It’s funny, she’s always been a bit of a lone wolf, but when it came to protecting me, she never hesitated. I don’t know what I would’ve done without her back then.</p><p>Now that we’re older, Syl’s got her own place here in Rosestone, a bit away from Dad and me. She likes her space, you know? But she’s still close by. We see each other a lot, and no matter how different we might be, there’s no one I trust more. She might seem tough and distant to some people, but I know there’s more to her than that. Underneath all the edgy clothes and fierce attitude, she’s still the big sister who would do anything to keep me safe. And honestly, she’s one of the smartest people I know. Strong, too, but not just in the way that she can physically overpower someone. It’s in the way she handles herself, in how she faces the world. Syl might act like she’s got no time for anyone’s nonsense, but when it comes down to it, she cares—just in her own way.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>" },

It’s easier to think when the world around me isn’t trying to intrude. Ebela has been good for that, especially since I built my underground lab. The space beneath my house is quiet—an escape from the noise and distractions of the surface. Zet tells me I should get out more, but honestly, there’s nothing up there that can compare to the things I can create down here.</p><p>Taru, my brother, doesn’t really get it. He’s content with simpler things, but I’ve always felt this need to push further, to see what I can make from the materials around me, from the data in my mind. Maybe it’s because of how we grew up on planet Rue—everything there was so rigid, so controlled. Moving to Ebela was the start of my freedom, a chance to follow my own ideas without restrictions.</p><p>My current project list is extensive. I’ve developed several artificial lifeforms, most notably Kara and Shine. Kara is... difficult. I designed her to be versatile, able to shapeshift and adapt to any situation. But with that freedom, she’s grown rebellious, constantly pushing against me. I didn’t expect her to develop such a strong sense of independence. Sometimes I wonder if I went too far with her genetics. It’s unsettling, but I can’t help but feel a strange pride watching her learn and grow—even if it’s not in the way I intended.</p><p>Shine, on the other hand, was much more straightforward. Zet asked for a companion, and I delivered. Shine is everything Zet wanted—cheerful, full of life, and... uncomplicated. He lives with her now, but I check in from time to time to make sure his systems are running smoothly. There’s always that risk when you create something from nothing—when does it stop being yours and start becoming its own entity?</p><p>The lab is a place of discovery, but not everything I’ve made is so innocent. There’s a part of my work I rarely talk about—a section of my lab that’s off-limits, even to myself. I’ve created things I’m not proud of. I don’t know how far my curiosity will take me, but some creations are better left in the dark. There’s danger in the pursuit of knowledge, and I’m beginning to learn that there are lines even I shouldn’t cross.</p><p>End Log.</p>" },

The older brother of the famed inventor Auray Asq’aro, Taru couldn’t be more different from his intellectually driven sibling. While Auray buries herself in blueprints and calculations, Taru thrives on the field, his body constantly in motion. Whether it’s soccer, frisbee, or even an improvised game of tag, he exudes energy, his athleticism turning every activity into a performance of grace and power. Taru’s dedication to sports is matched only by his drive to make friends, a mission he approaches with heartfelt enthusiasm—often to his detriment.</p><p>Despite his physical prowess, Taru is blissfully naive, a trait that endears him to some and frustrates others. His near-zero intelligence and childlike gullibility make him an easy mark for manipulation. A simple compliment can send him into someone’s service without a second thought. Yet, Taru never seems to notice or mind. He genuinely believes in the good of others, even when they exploit him. His boundless trust, while a flaw to many, is to him an essential part of who he is—a belief that everyone deserves a friend, even if it costs him.</p><p>Taru’s most cherished relationship is with Than, his gender-fluid significant other. To Taru, Than’s identity is simply another beautiful aspect of who they are. He showers them with unending support, often attending their events or hobbies with unreserved cheer, even when he doesn’t entirely understand what’s going on. His love is expressed through action rather than words—helping them practice speeches, surprising them with thoughtful gifts, or simply showing up with that signature grin and unshakable belief in their brilliance. To Than, Taru’s unwavering presence is a comforting constant in an unpredictable world.</p><p>Though he lacks the intellectual spark of his sister or the sharp wit of others around him, Taru’s contributions to his community are invaluable. He fosters a sense of joy and connection wherever he goes, reminding even the most cynical that life is meant to be lived with an open heart. In Sapphire Creek Park and beyond, Taru’s laughter and infectious enthusiasm are proof that strength comes in many forms, and sometimes, the simplest acts of kindness can leave the most profound impact.</p>" },

Born from the groundbreaking research of Auray Asq'aro, Kara was the first successful creation of artificial life in Auray’s laboratory. With a body engineered from a blend of cutting-edge science and experimental materials, Kara is every bit as complex as she is lively. Her bright yellow skin, a hallmark of her unique origin, practically glows with energy, mirroring her vibrant and adventurous personality.</p><p>Though Auray loves Kara as a daughter, Kara doesn’t quite view herself as part of a family. It’s not that she doesn’t care for Auray—she does, in her own mischievous way—but she thrives on independence and the freedom to explore her boundless creativity. For Kara, life is a playground, and her shapeshifting ability is her favorite toy. This power allows her to modify her form at will: stretching, shrinking, changing texture, and even mimicking objects or other beings. She wields this ability with a mix of artistry and impishness, often sneaking through Auray’s lab as a sliver of liquid or playfully impersonating visitors to confuse and amuse them.</p><p>Her small, lithe frame makes her a master of stealth, though Kara rarely uses her agility for anything noble. She much prefers sneaking out of the lab to explore the world on her own terms, often slipping through the streets of Rosestone unnoticed or blending seamlessly into new environments. Her favorite pastime is playing pranks—disappearing into shadows to startle unsuspecting passersby or morphing into fantastical forms to cause harmless chaos. She approaches every situation with a dominant sense of curiosity, wanting to bend her surroundings to her imagination just to see what happens.</p><p>Despite her mischievous nature, Kara is deeply innovative, often creating solutions to problems on the fly with her shapeshifting ability or her sharp intellect. She possesses a spark of creativity that mirrors her creator’s genius, though it’s expressed in far more whimsical and unpredictable ways. For all her antics, Kara harbors an unspoken respect for Auray and the life she was given. She may reject the traditional idea of family, but she’s fiercely proud of the freedom she embodies—a living testament to her creator’s brilliance and her own boundless potential.</p>" },

In her presence, there is a hush, not of reverence, but of fear—a misunderstood reverie cloaked in dark fabric and guarded by silence. Her crimson eyes, like twin embers beneath a veil of ash, speak truths she can no longer express, for her voice is bound by an ancient curse—a language of lost souls, the whispered tongue of demons, falling like the fragments of broken stone. Words that twist through the air, understood by none but those brave enough to listen.</p><p>It was Nerix, her friend in shadow, who changed her fate—a pact born not from malice, but from curiosity’s cruel blade. On a night lost to memory, Nerix beckoned the dark, and Mortala became the altar. A transformation, both terrible and beautiful, surged through her body, leaving her form towering, immense, and crowned by a solitary horn, as if marking her as both beast and queen. Red flooded her gaze, a symbol of power unmatched but cursed with a price—her tongue taken by an ancient dialect, leaving her voice as foreign as the stars are to the sea.</p><p>Yet, she bears no resentment toward Nerix for the change. Mortala wears her curse like a shroud of distinction, a mark of what sets her apart from a world too eager to judge. Prejudice clings to her in the streets of Armridge, where fearful whispers follow her every step. The edges of humanity recoil from her gothic silhouette, from the gleam of her red-stained eyes and the black horn that cleaves through the fog like a beacon. But Mortala remains unmoved, as still and deliberate as a clock’s midnight toll—gracious in her dominance, always courteous, even when the world bares its teeth in ignorance.</p><p>And so, she treads the narrow alleys of Armridge alongside Nerix, who serves as her voice, the translator of her sorrow and joy, though neither emotion stirs easily upon her face. With every step, Mortala drifts further from the expectations of the light, but never succumbs to the darkness entirely. Her life, a quiet rebellion written in silence and shadows, speaks louder than any word. And though her tongue is bound in cryptic dead speech, Mortala knows the language of understanding is written between souls, not spoken aloud.</p>" },

At just over a hundred years old—a mere prime for her kind—Petaya has cultivated an unparalleled bond with the forest that stretches beyond her doorstep. Her tall, imposing frame and outdoorsy attire blend seamlessly with the wild landscape she calls home, a testament to her deep-rooted connection to nature. With a balance of physical strength and mental acuity, she is a force both graceful and formidable, embodying the spirit of the forest itself.</p><p>Petaya’s sagacious nature sets her apart, granting her an almost uncanny ability to understand people and situations. She possesses a charisma that draws others in, often compelling them to her side with little effort. Her charm is matched only by her confidence; she has a knack for making others see the wisdom in her perspective, and more often than not, they follow her lead. Yet, this dominance can sometimes veer into overbearing territory—her larger-than-life personality and physical presence overwhelming those unprepared for her exuberance. Still, her heart is kind, and her intentions are nearly always rooted in genuine care and the desire to help.</p><p>Her life is one of balance, spent tending to her beloved garden or wandering the forest paths, where her presence feels as natural as the wind through the trees. Petaya’s cottage is a sanctuary of warmth and life, its walls adorned with dried herbs and its yard filled with carefully nurtured plants. Though she is imposing, her home exudes an inviting aura that reflects her generous spirit. Visitors to her home often leave with their arms full of produce or flowers, as Petaya delights in sharing the fruits of her labor.</p><p>Despite her nurturing qualities, Petaya’s strength is not just physical but also emotional. She is a stalwart companion, ready to shoulder the burdens of those she cares for, even if they resist at first. For all her formidable traits, she is deeply empathetic, her sharp discernment tempered by a profound understanding of others’ needs.

However, this royal responsibility is something Morelia struggles to accept. Though she wields tremendous physical strength, far surpassing most of her kin, Morelia is known more for her joyful and playful nature than for her power. Unlike her ruthless mother, Morelia is submissive, with a heart full of warmth and a carefree attitude. She finds it hard to live up to her mother’s expectations, as her dimwitted nature often leaves her at odds with the duties of her royal title.</p><p>While her sister Boa sneaks out of the castle to indulge in her mischievous tendencies, Morelia simply longs for moments of happiness and play—which are rare within the grim, dark walls of the Unholy Castle. Queen Avi is relentless in her attempts to mold Morelia into the perfect heir, pushing her constantly to be more ruthless and cunning, qualities that Morelia simply doesn’t possess. Morelia struggles under the weight of these expectations, often feeling like she’s stuck between two worlds: the one her mother wants her to rule, and the one in her heart, where she just wants to smile and play.</p><p>The one bright spot in Morelia’s life is her secret friendship with Socks, the daughter of Queen Bela, ruler of the Borealis Kingdom. Despite their mothers being sworn enemies, Morelia and Socks found each other through chance and formed an inseparable bond. Morelia finds peace and joy in Socks’ company, often sneaking out of the castle to meet her in secret. Their playful escapades provide Morelia with the escape she desperately needs, allowing her to be herself, free from the pressures of royal duty. Socks, who is far cleverer than Morelia, often takes the lead in their adventures, and the two spend hours laughing and playing—completely oblivious to the animosity between their kingdoms.</p><p>Even though Queen Avi and Queen Bela would be furious if they found out, Morelia doesn’t care. To her, Socks is the one friend who sees her for who she truly is—not a princess, not a future queen, but just a silly, playful girl who wants to find happiness. Morelia lives in the shadow of great expectations, but with Socks by her side, she manages to carve out moments of joy in her otherwise demanding and lonely life.</p>" },

Few in all of Ebela dare to challenge her directly, and those who have are either buried in the molten depths of Gravedes or reduced to tales of caution whispered among the defiant.</p><p>Her ambition knows no bounds. Avi craves dominion over all of Ebela, her vision of conquest painted in the red hues of war and the black of submission. Yet, the golden empire of Borealis continues to stand as a glittering reminder of what she cannot have. Their resistance enrages her, feeding a seething hatred that fuels her every decision. Her short temper and lack of foresight often hinder her, turning potential victories into grudges she cannot let go of. For Avi, there is no compromise, only conquest—and she will twist every resource and being in her possession to achieve it.</p><p>Her daughters, Morelia and Boa, are perhaps her greatest failures. Both reject her iron-fisted rule, their disdain for her ambitions and methods a constant thorn in her side. Morelia, blessed with Avi’s monstrous strength, uses it for frivolity and play rather than power. Boa, cunning but willful, treats her position as a princess more like a stage for mischief than a throne-in-waiting. Their disobedience gnaws at Avi’s pride, each defiant act an unspoken challenge to her authority. Yet, for all her strength, even Avi cannot force loyalty from those who will not give it.</p><p>Within the walls of the Unholy Castle, Avi’s wrath is legend. Servants cower at her approach, the air thick with the threat of her unpredictable fury. Her serpentine tail carves grooves into the stone floors as she moves, a constant reminder of her primal power. Her evil is not subtle; it is an avalanche, sweeping away anything that stands in her way. And though her methods lack elegance, there is a raw tenacity to her—a refusal to yield, to break, or to falter—that makes her a force both terrible and awe-inspiring.</p>" },

A Ruian girl of diminutive size and delicate frame, Nerix’s physical presence belies her formidable intelligence and commanding personality. Though physically feeble, her meticulous attention to detail and sharp mind render her a force to be reckoned with in the field of dark arts and arcane knowledge.</p><p>Her preoccupation with demonic rituals and forbidden practices isn’t just a hobby—it’s a lifestyle. Nerix has spent years poring over ancient texts and forbidden tomes, teaching herself techniques that most wouldn’t dare to attempt. Chief among her achievements is her ability to manipulate body mass through touch, a power that feels both intimate and invasive. This skill allows her to shrink those who cross her, reducing antagonists to tiny versions of themselves and leaving them to deal with their newfound helplessness. Though rarely applied to allies, her ability remains a potent reminder of her control over the space she occupies.</p><p>Nerix’s life isn’t entirely solitary. She shares her apartment with Mortala, a fellow Ruian who is both her closest companion and an unwitting artifact of her experimentation. Years ago, Mortala volunteered—or perhaps was coerced—for a demonic ritual that permanently altered her form, leaving her stronger and scarred with unearthly attributes. While some might regret such an act, Nerix views it as a testament to her growing mastery. The two share a peculiar but functional bond, with Mortala providing a grounded counterpoint to Nerix’s insular tendencies.</p><p>Despite her isolation, Nerix isn’t entirely cut off from the world. She moves through life with a calculated detachment, observing and dissecting those around her. Her cold exterior masks a relentless curiosity about the mechanics of life and power. To those she favors, Nerix’s loyalty is unwavering, and her sharp wit and occult expertise make her an invaluable ally. To those who earn her ire, however, her meticulous nature ensures that her revenge will be both precise and deeply unsettling. In Armridge’s fog-shrouded streets, Nerix is a figure of quiet dominance, a small shadow with a looming influence.</p>" },

Though she is diminutive in stature, her presence is overwhelming—a force of passion and intellect that commands attention, even if she rarely invites it. Her disdain for her surname is almost legendary, a piece of her past she guards with venomous secrecy.</p><p>Tink's small and frail body belies the terrifying power she wields, enhanced through her own ingenuity. With cybernetic implants and the ability to grow herself to hyper sizes, she has transcended the physical limitations that once threatened to slow her progress. Her creations, often monstrous in form and function, reflect her philosophy: science exists to be pushed to its breaking point. Tink's disdain for the cautious nature of her peers is no secret.

But as Mutsuko lay on her slab, the lab’s unstable environment betrayed her. A piece of faulty equipment crashed down, shattering the fragile equilibrium needed to complete the process. Mutsuko awakened too soon—damaged, uncontrollable, and fractured both in form and mind. The creature’s disobedience was not a calculated rebellion but a chaotic, instinctive rejection of Tink’s will. The failure scarred her, a constant reminder of the fine line between brilliance and disaster.</p><p>Now, Tink exists in a state of furious resolve, channeling her frustrations into further experimentation. She has no tolerance for those who question her methods, dismissing moral debates as distractions for the weak. Visitors are not welcome in her domain, and those who stumble upon her lair are rarely met with kindness.
