"name: "Zet","
"desc: "<p>When we first arrived on Earth’s Ebela Island, I was struck by how different everything felt. The place was mysterious and magical, with its deep forests and ancient ruins, but it was also a world away from where I grew up. My father, Syl, and I moved here to start over, hoping that a fresh beginning would help us all forget the pain of the past. But no matter how hard we tried, the absence of my mother still hung over us like a shadow. She vanished years ago, leaving behind questions that would never be answered, and even though we didn’t talk about it much, we all felt the void she left behind.</p><p>Growing up wasn’t easy for me. My blue skin and... well, let’s just say my “unique” appearance made me a target for bullies. Kids can be cruel, and I learned that the hard way. They teased me relentlessly, and it hurt more than I ever let on. But I’m not one to dwell on the bad stuff. I’ve always tried to keep a cheery attitude, even when things were tough. My dad says it’s one of my best qualities, finding the bright side, no matter what.</p><p>When we moved to Rosestone, I didn’t know what to expect. It’s a small suburban town, but there was something comforting about its ordinary charm. The Ruians here were different, too. They were kind, welcoming even. It was like they didn’t see me as some strange alien girl; they just saw me as Zet, another neighbor in their little community. That warmth helped heal a lot of the scars I carried from my childhood.</p><p>The best thing that happened in Rosestone, though, was meeting Auray Asq'aro. She’s a genius, seriously! And the best friend I could ever ask for. She understood me in a way that no one else did. Seeing how much I needed companionship, she created Shine Retrac, an artificial Ruian boy who’s now like a little brother to me. Shine is so full of life and energy; he practically radiates happiness. Together, we explore Rosestone, finding adventure in the most ordinary places.</p><p>Living here has taught me so much about accepting myself. The kindness I’ve found, the friends I’ve made, and the bond I share with my family have turned Rosestone into more than just a new home. It’s a place where I’ve finally found peace with who I am. And that’s something I never thought I’d have.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>""

    "name": "Shine",
    "desc": "<p>Shine Vathezvo stands as a testament to the brilliance—and the occasional unpredictability—of Auray Asq’aro’s creations. Born not of nature but of invention, Shine was meticulously engineered in the depths of Auray’s laboratory to be a companion for Zet Arder. While his grey, rubbery skin is a subtle departure from the vibrant hues of most Ruians, his unassuming appearance was intentional—a balance between familiarity and function, ensuring his acceptance while hinting at his unique origins.</p><p>Shine’s personality reflects his purpose. He is gracious and kind, a calming presence in Zet’s life. Their bond is not one of creator and construct but of equals, with Shine serving as Zet’s loyal companion and, over time, her partner. Though they call each other boyfriend and girlfriend, Shine remains dedicated to his role as a supportive figure. He tends to Zet’s home in Rosestone with quiet diligence, managing chores and ensuring her life runs smoothly. For all his otherworldly abilities, his focus remains grounded in simplicity and devotion.</p><p>Yet Shine’s body holds remarkable secrets, a marvel of Auray’s ingenuity. His rubbery form can stretch without limit, an ability that grants him both versatility and resilience. Invincible to physical harm, Shine can survive circumstances that would destroy most beings, though he experiences pain like any other. This paradox makes him both fearless and deeply empathetic. His invulnerability is not a shield from suffering but a reminder of the sacrifices inherent in his design. When exploring Ebela Island, he approaches its wonders and dangers with cautious curiosity, meeting its diverse inhabitants with warmth and openness. Despite his travels and the fascinating figures he encounters, Shine’s loyalty to Zet is unwavering, his heart firmly tethered to the girl who gave him a purpose beyond his origins.</p><p>Though created to serve, Shine has developed a quiet independence. He reflects often on his identity—part invention, part individual—and the ethical intricacies of his existence. These musings are private, shared only in fleeting moments with Zet or Auray. He embraces his life with gratitude, finding meaning in his relationships and the experiences he gathers on his journeys. Shine is, in many ways, a mirror for those he meets: unassuming yet extraordinary, humble yet unbreakable, a being who embodies the complexity of creation and the simplicity of kindness.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"

    "name": "Syl",
    "desc": "<p>You know my sister, Syl? Yeah, she’s pretty hard to miss. If you ever see a tall Ruian girl with purple skin, rocking black chokers, fishnets, and all those edgy clothes, that’s her. She’s got this whole “hardcore” thing going on, totally opposite of me. I’m all smiles and sunshine, but Syl? She’s more... intense. Always has been. She’s a bit taller than me, too—7'2, not that she ever lets me forget it. But trust me, she’s not just all attitude and style. Syl’s got this strong sense of nobility to her. You know, that kind of high moral compass that just demands respect.</p><p>When we were little, Syl was like my personal bodyguard. Seriously, whenever kids would mess with me for being, well, me, she was there—strong, smart, and unshakable. I’ll never forget how she stood up for me. It wasn’t just about beating up bullies (although, yeah, she could totally take them). She was always the one who saw things clearly, who knew what was right and wouldn’t let anyone push us around. It’s funny, she’s always been a bit of a lone wolf, but when it came to protecting me, she never hesitated. I don’t know what I would’ve done without her back then.</p><p>Now that we’re older, Syl’s got her own place here in Rosestone, a bit away from Dad and me. She likes her space, you know? But she’s still close by. We see each other a lot, and no matter how different we might be, there’s no one I trust more. She might seem tough and distant to some people, but I know there’s more to her than that. Underneath all the edgy clothes and fierce attitude, she’s still the big sister who would do anything to keep me safe. And honestly, she’s one of the smartest people I know. Strong, too, but not just in the way that she can physically overpower someone. It’s in the way she handles herself, in how she faces the world. Syl might act like she’s got no time for anyone’s nonsense, but when it comes down to it, she cares—just in her own way.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"
