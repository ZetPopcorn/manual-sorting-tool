The place was mysterious and magical, with its deep forests and ancient ruins, but it was also a world away from where I grew up. My father, Syl, and I moved here to start over, hoping that a fresh beginning would help us all forget the pain of the past. But no matter how hard we tried, the absence of my mother still hung over us like a shadow. She vanished years ago, leaving behind questions that would never be answered, and even though we didn’t talk about it much, we all felt the void she left behind.</p><p>Growing up wasn’t easy for me. My blue skin and... well, let’s just say my “unique” appearance made me a target for bullies. Kids can be cruel, and I learned that the hard way. They teased me relentlessly, and it hurt more than I ever let on. But I’m not one to dwell on the bad stuff. I’ve always tried to keep a cheery attitude, even when things were tough. My dad says it’s one of my best qualities, finding the bright side, no matter what.</p><p>When we moved to Rosestone, I didn’t know what to expect. It’s a small suburban town, but there was something comforting about its ordinary charm. The Ruians here were different, too. They were kind, welcoming even. It was like they didn’t see me as some strange alien girl; they just saw me as Zet, another neighbor in their little community. That warmth helped heal a lot of the scars I carried from my childhood.</p><p>The best thing that happened in Rosestone, though, was meeting Auray Asq'aro. She’s a genius, seriously! And the best friend I could ever ask for. She understood me in a way that no one else did. Seeing how much I needed companionship, she created Shine Retrac, an artificial Ruian boy who’s now like a little brother to me. Shine is so full of life and energy; he practically radiates happiness. Together, we explore Rosestone, finding adventure in the most ordinary places.</p><p>Living here has taught me so much about accepting myself. The kindness I’ve found, the friends I’ve made, and the bond I share with my family have turned Rosestone into more than just a new home. It’s a place where I’ve finally found peace with who I am. And that’s something I never thought I’d have.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>" },

Born not of nature but of invention, Shine was meticulously engineered in the depths of Auray’s laboratory to be a companion for Zet Arder. While his grey, rubbery skin is a subtle departure from the vibrant hues of most Ruians, his unassuming appearance was intentional—a balance between familiarity and function, ensuring his acceptance while hinting at his unique origins.</p><p>Shine’s personality reflects his purpose. He is gracious and kind, a calming presence in Zet’s life. Their bond is not one of creator and construct but of equals, with Shine serving as Zet’s loyal companion and, over time, her partner. Though they call each other boyfriend and girlfriend, Shine remains dedicated to his role as a supportive figure. He tends to Zet’s home in Rosestone with quiet diligence, managing chores and ensuring her life runs smoothly. For all his otherworldly abilities, his focus remains grounded in simplicity and devotion.</p><p>Yet Shine’s body holds remarkable secrets, a marvel of Auray’s ingenuity. His rubbery form can stretch without limit, an ability that grants him both versatility and resilience. Invincible to physical harm, Shine can survive circumstances that would destroy most beings, though he experiences pain like any other. This paradox makes him both fearless and deeply empathetic. His invulnerability is not a shield from suffering but a reminder of the sacrifices inherent in his design. When exploring Ebela Island, he approaches its wonders and dangers with cautious curiosity, meeting its diverse inhabitants with warmth and openness. Despite his travels and the fascinating figures he encounters, Shine’s loyalty to Zet is unwavering, his heart firmly tethered to the girl who gave him a purpose beyond his origins.</p><p>Though created to serve, Shine has developed a quiet independence. He reflects often on his identity—part invention, part individual—and the ethical intricacies of his existence. These musings are private, shared only in fleeting moments with Zet or Auray. He embraces his life with gratitude, finding meaning in his relationships and the experiences he gathers on his journeys. Shine is, in many ways, a mirror for those he meets: unassuming yet extraordinary, humble yet unbreakable, a being who embodies the complexity of creation and the simplicity of kindness.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>" },

Yeah, she’s pretty hard to miss. If you ever see a tall Ruian girl with purple skin, rocking black chokers, fishnets, and all those edgy clothes, that’s her. She’s got this whole “hardcore” thing going on, totally opposite of me. I’m all smiles and sunshine, but Syl? She’s more... intense. Always has been. She’s a bit taller than me, too—7'2, not that she ever lets me forget it. But trust me, she’s not just all attitude and style. Syl’s got this strong sense of nobility to her. You know, that kind of high moral compass that just demands respect.</p><p>When we were little, Syl was like my personal bodyguard. Seriously, whenever kids would mess with me for being, well, me, she was there—strong, smart, and unshakable. I’ll never forget how she stood up for me. It wasn’t just about beating up bullies (although, yeah, she could totally take them). She was always the one who saw things clearly, who knew what was right and wouldn’t let anyone push us around. It’s funny, she’s always been a bit of a lone wolf, but when it came to protecting me, she never hesitated. I don’t know what I would’ve done without her back then.</p><p>Now that we’re older, Syl’s got her own place here in Rosestone, a bit away from Dad and me. She likes her space, you know? But she’s still close by. We see each other a lot, and no matter how different we might be, there’s no one I trust more. She might seem tough and distant to some people, but I know there’s more to her than that. Underneath all the edgy clothes and fierce attitude, she’s still the big sister who would do anything to keep me safe. And honestly, she’s one of the smartest people I know. Strong, too, but not just in the way that she can physically overpower someone. It’s in the way she handles herself, in how she faces the world. Syl might act like she’s got no time for anyone’s nonsense, but when it comes down to it, she cares—just in her own way.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>" },

It’s easier to think when the world around me isn’t trying to intrude. Ebela has been good for that, especially since I built my underground lab. The space beneath my house is quiet—an escape from the noise and distractions of the surface. Zet tells me I should get out more, but honestly, there’s nothing up there that can compare to the things I can create down here.</p><p>Taru, my brother, doesn’t really get it. He’s content with simpler things, but I’ve always felt this need to push further, to see what I can make from the materials around me, from the data in my mind. Maybe it’s because of how we grew up on planet Rue—everything there was so rigid, so controlled. Moving to Ebela was the start of my freedom, a chance to follow my own ideas without restrictions.</p><p>My current project list is extensive. I’ve developed several artificial lifeforms, most notably Kara and Shine. Kara is... difficult. I designed her to be versatile, able to shapeshift and adapt to any situation. But with that freedom, she’s grown rebellious, constantly pushing against me. I didn’t expect her to develop such a strong sense of independence. Sometimes I wonder if I went too far with her genetics. It’s unsettling, but I can’t help but feel a strange pride watching her learn and grow—even if it’s not in the way I intended.</p><p>Shine, on the other hand, was much more straightforward. Zet asked for a companion, and I delivered. Shine is everything Zet wanted—cheerful, full of life, and... uncomplicated. He lives with her now, but I check in from time to time to make sure his systems are running smoothly. There’s always that risk when you create something from nothing—when does it stop being yours and start becoming its own entity?</p><p>The lab is a place of discovery, but not everything I’ve made is so innocent. There’s a part of my work I rarely talk about—a section of my lab that’s off-limits, even to myself. I’ve created things I’m not proud of. I don’t know how far my curiosity will take me, but some creations are better left in the dark. There’s danger in the pursuit of knowledge, and I’m beginning to learn that there are lines even I shouldn’t cross.</p><p>End Log.</p>" },

The older brother of the famed inventor Auray Asq’aro, Taru couldn’t be more different from his intellectually driven sibling. While Auray buries herself in blueprints and calculations, Taru thrives on the field, his body constantly in motion. Whether it’s soccer, frisbee, or even an improvised game of tag, he exudes energy, his athleticism turning every activity into a performance of grace and power. Taru’s dedication to sports is matched only by his drive to make friends, a mission he approaches with heartfelt enthusiasm—often to his detriment.</p><p>Despite his physical prowess, Taru is blissfully naive, a trait that endears him to some and frustrates others. His near-zero intelligence and childlike gullibility make him an easy mark for manipulation. A simple compliment can send him into someone’s service without a second thought. Yet, Taru never seems to notice or mind. He genuinely believes in the good of others, even when they exploit him. His boundless trust, while a flaw to many, is to him an essential part of who he is—a belief that everyone deserves a friend, even if it costs him.</p><p>Taru’s most cherished relationship is with Than, his gender-fluid significant other. To Taru, Than’s identity is simply another beautiful aspect of who they are. He showers them with unending support, often attending their events or hobbies with unreserved cheer, even when he doesn’t entirely understand what’s going on. His love is expressed through action rather than words—helping them practice speeches, surprising them with thoughtful gifts, or simply showing up with that signature grin and unshakable belief in their brilliance. To Than, Taru’s unwavering presence is a comforting constant in an unpredictable world.</p><p>Though he lacks the intellectual spark of his sister or the sharp wit of others around him, Taru’s contributions to his community are invaluable. He fosters a sense of joy and connection wherever he goes, reminding even the most cynical that life is meant to be lived with an open heart. In Sapphire Creek Park and beyond, Taru’s laughter and infectious enthusiasm are proof that strength comes in many forms, and sometimes, the simplest acts of kindness can leave the most profound impact.</p>" },

Born from the groundbreaking research of Auray Asq'aro, Kara was the first successful creation of artificial life in Auray’s laboratory. With a body engineered from a blend of cutting-edge science and experimental materials, Kara is every bit as complex as she is lively. Her bright yellow skin, a hallmark of her unique origin, practically glows with energy, mirroring her vibrant and adventurous personality.</p><p>Though Auray loves Kara as a daughter, Kara doesn’t quite view herself as part of a family. It’s not that she doesn’t care for Auray—she does, in her own mischievous way—but she thrives on independence and the freedom to explore her boundless creativity. For Kara, life is a playground, and her shapeshifting ability is her favorite toy. This power allows her to modify her form at will: stretching, shrinking, changing texture, and even mimicking objects or other beings. She wields this ability with a mix of artistry and impishness, often sneaking through Auray’s lab as a sliver of liquid or playfully impersonating visitors to confuse and amuse them.</p><p>Her small, lithe frame makes her a master of stealth, though Kara rarely uses her agility for anything noble. She much prefers sneaking out of the lab to explore the world on her own terms, often slipping through the streets of Rosestone unnoticed or blending seamlessly into new environments. Her favorite pastime is playing pranks—disappearing into shadows to startle unsuspecting passersby or morphing into fantastical forms to cause harmless chaos. She approaches every situation with a dominant sense of curiosity, wanting to bend her surroundings to her imagination just to see what happens.</p><p>Despite her mischievous nature, Kara is deeply innovative, often creating solutions to problems on the fly with her shapeshifting ability or her sharp intellect. She possesses a spark of creativity that mirrors her creator’s genius, though it’s expressed in far more whimsical and unpredictable ways. For all her antics, Kara harbors an unspoken respect for Auray and the life she was given. She may reject the traditional idea of family, but she’s fiercely proud of the freedom she embodies—a living testament to her creator’s brilliance and her own boundless potential.</p>" },

In her presence, there is a hush, not of reverence, but of fear—a misunderstood reverie cloaked in dark fabric and guarded by silence. Her crimson eyes, like twin embers beneath a veil of ash, speak truths she can no longer express, for her voice is bound by an ancient curse—a language of lost souls, the whispered tongue of demons, falling like the fragments of broken stone. Words that twist through the air, understood by none but those brave enough to listen.</p><p>It was Nerix, her friend in shadow, who changed her fate—a pact born not from malice, but from curiosity’s cruel blade. On a night lost to memory, Nerix beckoned the dark, and Mortala became the altar. A transformation, both terrible and beautiful, surged through her body, leaving her form towering, immense, and crowned by a solitary horn, as if marking her as both beast and queen. Red flooded her gaze, a symbol of power unmatched but cursed with a price—her tongue taken by an ancient dialect, leaving her voice as foreign as the stars are to the sea.</p><p>Yet, she bears no resentment toward Nerix for the change. Mortala wears her curse like a shroud of distinction, a mark of what sets her apart from a world too eager to judge. Prejudice clings to her in the streets of Armridge, where fearful whispers follow her every step. The edges of humanity recoil from her gothic silhouette, from the gleam of her red-stained eyes and the black horn that cleaves through the fog like a beacon. But Mortala remains unmoved, as still and deliberate as a clock’s midnight toll—gracious in her dominance, always courteous, even when the world bares its teeth in ignorance.</p><p>And so, she treads the narrow alleys of Armridge alongside Nerix, who serves as her voice, the translator of her sorrow and joy, though neither emotion stirs easily upon her face. With every step, Mortala drifts further from the expectations of the light, but never succumbs to the darkness entirely. Her life, a quiet rebellion written in silence and shadows, speaks louder than any word. And though her tongue is bound in cryptic dead speech, Mortala knows the language of understanding is written between souls, not spoken aloud.</p>" }
